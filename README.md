# Capstone Project - Spotify Music

In this project, I build a predictive model for a clustering problem.

Using a dataset found on Kaggle about Spotify data including artist, album, track names and track features.
I am then able to create a KMeans clustering model and another one including PCA in order to predict new data based on a final model created.
